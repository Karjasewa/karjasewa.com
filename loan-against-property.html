                                    <p>When bank or NBFC provides loan to the borrower against his property is called loan against property. It is like personal loan where loan amount can be utilized by the borrower to fulfill his personal or business need
                                        but there are various differences between the personal loan and loan against property for private financer in Nepal, which are as follows:</p>
                                    <strong>Rate of Interest:</strong> Personal loan is an unsecured loan so bank or NBFC charges high rate of interest on personal loan. Personal loan rate of interest offered by bank or NBFC ranging from 10% p.a. to 30%
                                    p.a. depends upon profile of the customer and his credit worthiness.
                                    <p></p>
                                    Loan against property is a secured loan which is secured against property of the borrower so lender charges comparatively low rate of interest. Loan against property rate of interest offered by bank or NBFC ranging from 8.50% p.a. to 18% p.a. depends
                                    upon profile of the customer and his credit worthiness.
                                    <p></p>
                                    <strong>Loan Tenure:</strong> Personal loan provided by the bank or NBFC for shorter period of time i.e. 1 year to 5 years.
                                    <p></p>
                                    Bank or NBFC offers longer period of time for repayment of loan against property. Loan tenure for loan against property at lowest interest rate is in between 3 years to 15 years. Even 20 years also offered by some bank or NBFC.
                                    <p></p>
                                    <strong>Loan Amount:</strong> As the personal loan is an unsecured loan so bank or NBFC imposed capping on the loan amount. Bank or NBFC provide up-to Rs. 50 lacs under personal loan.
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>As the loan against property is a secured loan so there is no capping on the loan amount by bank or NBFC. A borrower can avail Rs. 10 lacs to Rs. 100 crore against his property subject to fulfillment of loan eligibility
                                        criteria.
                                        <p></p>
                                        <strong>EMI:</strong> EMI calculation depends upon three factors i.e. (i) Loan Amount, (ii) Loan Tenure, and (iii) Rate of Interest. Due to lower rate of interest and longer repayment period, EMI on loan against
                                        property is lower than personal loan. Loan against Property in Nepal NCR is provided by Karjasewa.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Age:</strong> At the time of loan against property application, applicant must be 21 years or above but not more than 60 or 65 years because repayment of the loan has to be completed on or before 60 or 65
                                            years of borrower age.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Employment Continuity:</strong> Bank or NBFC checks employment continuity of an individual who is applying for loan against property. An individual should have 3 years of working experience in the business
                                            or employment. A regular source of income, ensure the lender regular repayment of their loan EMI.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cibil Score:</strong> A loan against property borrower who is having good cibil score will get quick loan from the bank or NBFC. Cibil score is a decisioning factor for sanctioning or rejecting loan against
                                            property applications.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Valid, Clear And Marketable Title Deeds Of Property:</strong> A loan against property borrower must be having valid, clear and marketable title deeds of entire chain of the property along with approved sanction
                                            plan or map. The ownership and physical possession of the property lies with the borrower only.</li>
                                    </ul>

                        <p>Before taking loan against property it is advisable to consider following factors:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Loan Eligibility:</strong> Check your loan against property eligibility, that how much loan you can borrow from bank or NBFC based on your income eligibility and market value of the property. All the banks or NBFC have
                                different product and policy to calculate the loan eligibility. Loan eligibility of a borrower also depends upon so many other factors like age, income, cibil score, work profile, financial stability, market value of the
                                property, loan to value (LTV) ratio etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rate Of Interest:</strong> Before taking loan against property, check rate of interest offered by different bank or NBFC as it has a major impact on your EMI. If rate of interest is high then EMI is also high, so choose
                                the bank which provides lower rate of interest so that EMI will not put extra loads on your business.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loan Processing Fees:</strong> Bank or NBFC charges loan processing fees to process your loan against property application. There are two types of charges one is loan processing fees and the other is loan administration
                                charges. <br> Loan processing fee charges by the bank or NBFC to process your loan application, valuation of the property, legal verification of the property, residence verification, office verification, due-diligence of
                                income documents and bank statement etc. It could be a fixed percentage of your loan amount or a fixed amount. <br> Loan administration charges are taken by bank or NBFC to maintain your loan account after disbursement.
                                Some bank or NBFC took upfront fees however some of them charged after sanction of the loan amount. So check loan processing charges of bank or NBFC deeply before applying for the loan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Part Payment Charges:</strong> When borrower want to make some payment towards principal amount of loan against property, bank or NBFC may charge part payment charges from the borrower. It is advisable to read the terms
                                and condition of your loan sanction letter and loan agreement carefully and make sure that it is not very high compared to market. <br> If you apply through <strong>Karjasewa</strong>, our professional consultant will
